represented. What that is, is left to the audience to determine/describe. Art is a form of scribe. A scribe is a message in which the meaning is told to you by the author. However, in art scribe the message is told by the audience thus there can be infinite interpretations."A Magician never reveals his secrets."\nMagic and illusion is an art form where this understanding has been honored and protected because once they reveal the trick (the message) there will be nothing left for the audience to believe. Behind each hill there is something, behind the lyrics there\'s a deeper story hidden within the beats, behind the illusions the intricate magical things that make the world.','When drama-driven dumb asses drum up the bullshit at high levels often causing the most common of occurrences to be uncomfortable for all involved.','Art is used as the shorter version of the common British greeting alright. It means that you are okay with something and accept.','A way to signify your opinion. To show your imagination...','Any one of the Divine Languages, including painting, sculpting, music, theatre, dance, poetry, etc.','Once when asked what Trans-Siberian Orchestra was about, Paul O\'Neill replied, "It\'s about creating great art. When asked to define what great art was, Paul said, "The purpose of art is to create an emotional response in the person that is exposed to that art. And there are three categories of art; bad art, good art and great art. Bad art will elicit no emotional response in the person that is exposed to it, i.e.; a song you hear in an elevator and it does nothing to you, a picture on a wall that gives you the same emotional response as if the wall had been blank, a movie that chews up time. Good art will make you feel an emotion that you have felt before; you see a picture of a forest and you remember the last time you went fishing with your dad, you hear a song about love and you remember the last time you were in love. Great art will make you feel an emotion you have never felt before; seeing the pieta, the world famous sculpture by Michelangelo, can cause someone to feel the pain of losing a child even if they\'ve never had one. And when you\'re trying for these emotions the easiest one to trigger is anger. Anyone can do it. Go into the street, throw a rock at someone, you will make them angry. The emotions of love, empathy and laughter are much harder to trigger, but since they operate on a deeper level, they bring a much greater reward.','"Art is making something out of nothing then selling it"']}},{source:{type:'audio',name:'Forvo',url:'https://ru.forvo.com/word/art/#en'},data:{audio:[{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/h/t/ht_8971696_39_2540_1.mp3',author:'jrbswim1',gender:'m',country:undefined},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/g/x/gx_9230373_39_2540.mp3',author:'JerrySun',gender:'m',country:undefined},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/5/x/5x_9467361_39_2540.mp3',author:'NipponJapan',gender:'m',country:undefined},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/z/o/zo_9065958_39_2540_1323565.mp3',author:'bananaman',gender:'m',country:'great britain'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/e/n/en_9853898_39_2540.mp3',author:'eggypp',gender:'m',country:'great britain'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/n/i/ni_9125401_39_2540_759552.mp3',author:'enfield',gender:'f',country:'great britain'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/s/3/s3_9156280_39_2540_1198768.mp3',author:'FlyHigh',gender:'f',country:'yemen'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/w/f/wf_8979922_49_2540_121323.mp3',author:'spl0uf',gender:'m',country:'france'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/o/l/ol_9489788_49_2540.mp3',author:'Champi',gender:'m',country:'france'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/e/v/ev_9505057_49_2540.mp3',gender:'m',country:'france'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/y/0/y0_8979374_34_2540_52391.mp3',author:'Vortarulo',gender:'m',country:'germany'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/i/9/i9_9218640_34_2540.mp3',author:'Thonatas',gender:'m',country:'germany'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/2/u/2u_8977002_34_2540_2602.mp3',author:'anouilh',gender:'f',country:'austria'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/r/i/ri_9135260_168_2540_1271124.mp3',author:'wubzylivesinatree',gender:'f',country:'turkey'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/g/v/gv_9289421_51_2540.mp3',author:'Drochmhadra',gender:'m',country:'ireland'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/u/8/u8_9930534_170_2540.mp3',author:'Sham2019',gender:'m',country:'russia'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/3/k/3k_9183007_157_2540_1488424.mp3',author:'kenthn',gender:'m',country:'sweden'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/i/4/i4_9930534_452_2540.mp3',author:'Sham2019',gender:'m',country:'russia'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/o/w/ow_9783636_152_2540.mp3',author:'Albana',gender:'f',country:'germany'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/g/z/gz_9295884_223_2540.mp3',author:'peppino1',gender:'m',country:'italy'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/e/t/et_9168882_120_2540_1316501.mp3',author:'Aleco',gender:'m',country:'norway'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/f/t/ft_9141062_101_2540_1175963.mp3',author:'yyylv',gender:'m',country:'latvia'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/k/o/ko_9053773_91_2540_1098139.mp3',author:'jowan',gender:'m',country:'great britain'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/j/9/j9_125_24_2540_504007.mp3',author:'vturiserra',gender:'m',country:'spain'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/c/0/c0_8986667_111_2540_123478.mp3',author:'Xlendin',gender:'m',country:'malta'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/6/7/67_8974660_33_2540_121262.mp3',author:'olfine',gender:'m',country:'denmark'}]}},{source:{type:'audio',name:'HowJSay.com',url:'https://howjsay.com/mp3/art.mp3'},data:{audio:[{url:'https://howjsay.com/mp3/art.mp3'}]}},{source:{type:'text',name:'Compromise Lexicon',url:'http://compromise.cool/'},data:{tag:[['Uncountable','Noun','Singular']]}}];
