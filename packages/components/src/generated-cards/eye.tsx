physical feature of another person (especially the eyes of a woman).  Unlike the breasts, legs, or gluteus maximus (which are often associated with physical beauty in women) the eyes hold value outside of the realm of sexuality.  (Some would even argue that, for this reason alone, the admiration of a woman\'s eyes is more respectable and pure than being physically attracted toward some element of her sex.) Some men find the most dazzling feature of a woman to be her eyes, leaving everything else as all but completely irrelevant.  Looking into a woman’s eyes, one can sometimes peer into her soul.','why look this up, if you dont have them you cant read this and probably have already had it explained to you that a certain item in/on your body is either missing or not working...good day to you','The window to the soul.','What noobs use to emphasize the word "I".
