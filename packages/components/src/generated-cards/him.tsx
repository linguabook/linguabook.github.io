You two talked and talked almost 24/7. Late night phone calls and the cheesiest conversations were held with this person. Eventually, this person got your hopes up and crushed them. Just. Like. That. Some shit happened between you two and now, you\'re strangers again. You walk past one another like nothing ever happened. Like you two never even met. You two make awkward eye-contact every now and then. You look at this person thinking that he used to mean the world to you. In fact, he once was your world. Maybe, he might even still mean the world to you. With every glance at him, memories come to mind. You suddenly hear his voice repeating things he once said to you, over and over. Recalling the good times, trying to forget the bad. After reading this, you are probably picturing him in your head, right now.','A truly amazing and beautiful Finnish band that lyrics resemble an ongoing story: a Romeo and Juliet kind of undying love with blindingly sensual & romantic lyrics. Beautiful keyboard melodies and rockin\' guitar riffs that go with the deep dark sensual voice of  singer and lyricalist Ville Valo who happens to be the most sexiest, beautiful talented man in rock \'n\' roll. They have a gothic, vampouric kind of look which makes ville and their music even more irresitable.  They\'ve created a new type of music, Love Metal which has a combination of darkness and light. Check out they\'re albums, Greatest Love Songs 666, Razorblade Romance, Deep shadows and brillinat highlights, Love Metal.','Powerpuff Girls\' counterpart of Satan.
