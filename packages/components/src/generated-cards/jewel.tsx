uniqueness and beauty. Her flaws are none, and her heart is that of a new born child. Complete innocence and purity. Her outward appearance is that which is most pleasing upon the eyes. And if not careful, one might mistake her for an Angel itself. Her elegant ways of life might make one feel petty and of no worth compared to one of such beauty and stature. But her words are as pleasing as harmonies music to the ears. And with love and kindness she can melt your scars and pain away into the past. Making one to feel as though they have reached a heaven in which no pain or bad things exsist. She is loyal till death, and never would compromise a relationship. She is honest and that of good heart. But is easily hurt and made to cry. But fear not, for she yearns only to forgive and forget, so all that remains is peace and happiness. If you had to describe Jewel in one simple word, it would have to simply be, Perfect.','When drama-driven dumb asses drum up the bullshit at high levels often causing the most common of occurrences to be uncomfortable for all involved.','Jewel is a girl that you\'d be lucky to call your best friend.
