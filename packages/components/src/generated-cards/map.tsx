It’s a new term pedophiles came up with to protect pedophiles from being identified as pedophiles. They claim it stands for Minor Attracted Person, but really it’s a sham of language. They use the word “minor” because it can evoke the image of a 17 year old when really they are talking about 4 year olds. They use the word “attracted” because it implies they might not act on it, but then they believe children can give consent (which would mean acting on it wouldn’t be immoral and thus they definitely WOULD act on it). Lastly, the biggest deception is using the word Person when they’re not really people, they’re pedophiles. It’s also not a coincidence it spells out MAP which is an innocuous, useful every day item when they are in fact the opposite of all those things (dangerous, useless, and a tiny disgusting subset of the population).
