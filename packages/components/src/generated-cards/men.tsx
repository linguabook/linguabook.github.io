Mostly because they think they want anything more than to enter their magical vaginia.','Men can be the most wonderful thing ever for a woman to meet , or they can be selfish pigs who want women to do everything for their lazy asses. All men are different , so you would have to get to know a man before you judge him , but women can be just as bad by judging him to soon and not loving a man , just wanting to suck him dry of his money. Some woman will respect a man and not care about the money , just how much they love their man. In return a REAL man should give respect back and love her , help her with the house work , and honestly think they are equals. Men should not have to respect women who are bitches to them and steal their money and so on , so if any man out their is being treated badly by a woman and getting no respect from their equal , and you ARE respecting her , then dump the bitch and go find yourself a REAL woman , and leave sterotypical woman behind.\n\nI know for a fact men and women are exactly the same , even though they look different , deep-down their all equals , because some women are either nice or mean and thats the same for men.\n\n if your a man and you think your better than all woman , just because your a man ... THEN FUCK YOU! AND IM TALKING TO THE WOMEN AS WELL IN THIS KIND OF MATTER!\n\nand unfortunately , woman have to suffer with periods and have mood swings they cant control sometimes , and REAL men will know she cant help it , will not judge and try to not get in the way of the mean machine of the month! \nIt affects men to , so sorry for the men who have to grin and bear it every once a month , but im sure it will help if you think about how the women is feeling just as bad as you ( pain-wise ).\n\nWithout men , the human race could survive.\n\nWithout women , the human race could not survive. \n                                           both men and women are responsible for being parents and should not leave the baby alone with the other parent , they should work together as a team. Sadly a lot of men still try to be better than woman and don\'t realize the equality. The olden days , when men ruled , women were useless because no-one taught them to do anything except raise kids and now look at today , how society has become better! I hope im alive to see men and women treated the same and the mojority of them dont act like complete pricks. With the women today , and how they are comparing to many years ago , i beleive that day will come some day.\n\nthe point of this is really...\n\nMen ... can\'t live with them , can\'t live without them.\n\nWoman ... can\'t live with them , can\'t live without them.\n\nI hope this writing makes you realise the true solution , even though the solution to the problem with men and women will probably solved on its on , in time...\n\nThank You For Reading :D :)','typo for the word meh']}},{source:{type:'audio',name:'Forvo',url:'https://ru.forvo.com/word/men/#en'},data:{audio:[{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/y/n/yn_8976598_39_387991_1.mp3',author:'falconfling',gender:'m',country:undefined},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/4/2/42_9666900_39_387991.mp3',author:'pocoapoco',gender:'f',country:undefined},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/6/l/6l_9468274_39_387991.mp3',author:'mmdills22',gender:'f',country:undefined},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/r/d/rd_9125401_39_387991_805153.mp3',author:'enfield',gender:'f',country:'great britain'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/8/z/8z_9388427_39_387991.mp3',author:'ManHub',gender:'m',country:'great britain'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/n/y/ny_9488892_39_387991.mp3',author:'Neptunium',gender:'m',country:'australia'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/t/u/tu_9003058_157_387991_123918.mp3',author:'KristinaEkstrand',gender:'f',country:'sweden'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/0/d/0d_9054384_33_387991_380594.mp3',author:'PepsiMaGs',gender:'f',country:'denmark'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/p/8/p8_9473280_33_387991.mp3',author:'danish911',gender:'f',country:'denmark'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/f/f/ff_8972981_62_387991_1098085.mp3',author:'jpgine',gender:'m',country:'andorra'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/g/8/g8_9145250_118_387991_1122192.mp3',author:'yoel',gender:'f',country:'netherlands'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/5/t/5t_9520356_118_387991.mp3',author:'hertogh',gender:'f',country:'netherlands'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/3/t/3t_9351455_168_387991.mp3',author:'FletcheR',gender:'m',country:'great britain'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/p/p/pp_8973927_325_387991.mp3',author:'slin',gender:'m',country:'germany'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/p/5/p5_9057789_120_387991_605804.mp3',author:'Larsipan',gender:'m',country:'norway'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/a/0/a0_9469434_43_387991.mp3',author:'jonabril',gender:'m',country:'spain'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/1/6/16_9335233_183_387991.mp3',author:'yosl',gender:'m',country:'germany'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/q/2/q2_9696220_176_387991.mp3',author:'Makhmudkhon',gender:'m',country:'uzbekistan'}]}},{source:{type:'audio',name:'HowJSay.com',url:'https://howjsay.com/mp3/men.mp3'},data:{audio:[{url:'https://howjsay.com/mp3/men.mp3'}]}},{source:{type:'text',name:'Compromise Lexicon',url:'http://compromise.cool/'},data:{tag:[['Plural','Noun']]}}];
