A person\'s nose is about as unique as their DNA. Some people have large noses. Some people have small noses. Some people have curved noses that make them look like they got punched in the face... hard. And the biggest questions... why do we have two nostrals?\n\nMany people never wash their nose. When tihs happens, the creases on the side of the nose become red. The nose produces more oil than any other part of the face.\n\nThe nose has the potential to ruin a date. We breathe through our nose for two reasons. One is so that we can constantly be aware of any smell, and two so that we don\'t share our bad breath that comes out of our mouth. Snot is also drained through the nose. This is the worst part about the nose. If you have snot in your nose, you can make embarassing sounds just by breathing. If you sniff your nose, you let everyone in the whole room know that you have boogers. If you don\'t sniff your nose, snot will run out, and boogers will eventually be blown out.\n\nThe nose has the potential to be more embarassing than a fart. It is a very good idea to thoroughly blow your nose before a social setting. Since many people are not socially outgoing enough to blow their nose in front of others, they discreetly whipe their nose if they have snot or pick thier nose if their have boogers.']}},{source:{type:'audio',name:'Forvo',url:'https://ru.forvo.com/word/nose/#en'},data:{audio:[{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/g/p/gp_8981864_39_14743_1894723.mp3',author:'TopQuark',gender:'m',country:'great britain'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/m/2/m2_9853898_39_14743.mp3',author:'eggypp',gender:'m',country:'great britain'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/p/t/pt_9863721_39_14743.mp3',author:'MichaelDS',gender:'m',country:'great britain'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/u/6/u6_8972856_39_14743_1.mp3',author:'Michaddison',gender:'f',country:undefined},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/a/d/ad_9043306_39_14743.mp3',author:'wkshimself',gender:'m',country:undefined},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/s/1/s1_9467361_39_14743.mp3',author:'NipponJapan',gender:'m',country:undefined},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/s/t/st_9187295_39_14743.mp3',author:'griffeblanche',gender:'f',country:undefined},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/z/g/zg_9218185_39_14743_1437173.mp3',author:'Bellb',gender:'m',country:undefined},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/b/8/b8_9260218_39_14743_1626848.mp3',author:'nateC',gender:'m',country:undefined},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/k/8/k8_9473364_41_14743.mp3',author:'John32',gender:'m',country:'peru'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/v/q/vq_9668306_58_14743.mp3',author:'lironhazan',gender:'m',country:'israel'}]}},{source:{type:'audio',name:'HowJSay.com',url:'https://howjsay.com/mp3/nose.mp3'},data:{audio:[{url:'https://howjsay.com/mp3/nose.mp3'}]}},{source:{type:'text',name:'Compromise Lexicon',url:'http://compromise.cool/'},data:{tag:[['Noun','Singular']]}}];
