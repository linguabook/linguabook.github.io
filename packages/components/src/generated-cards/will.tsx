Will is a timeless soul like a vampire or something immortal. When Will goes out in public men stare in jealousy or run to his assistance. Women stare, breathlessly, wet and wishing. He is so tall and built like a God. Naturally fit and muscular with perfect brown hair. When Will has his eyes on a girl, all he has to do is look at her with that irresistible, sexy smile and his sparkling, green glittering eyes that without fail will pull any girl to her knees begging to be enslaved. When you talk to Will it’s like you are in a dream a different dimension and the world as you know it is no longer. Time stops. Like the matrix. Will controls time and can keep you in his world as long as he wants you there and he will get you addicted to the feeling he gives you so much that you’ll end up leaving everything you’ve ever known just to stay in his force field, high on his existence. With Will time flies by and you won’t even know it because you’re just in awe of his magic. Will invented magic. He himself is a phenomenon! If you meet a Will you should study his every move and observe his way because he is the way, the truth and the light. And where there is a Will there is a way. He is the Will to survive. Will is Life.']}},{source:{type:'audio',name:'Forvo',url:'https://ru.forvo.com/word/will/#en'},data:{audio:[{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/s/6/s6_8971534_39_5889_1.mp3',author:'bjhinton',gender:'m',country:undefined},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/6/t/6t_8986237_39_5889_1098081.mp3',gender:'m',country:undefined},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/n/h/nh_9187295_39_5889.mp3',author:'griffeblanche',gender:'f',country:undefined},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/p/2/p2_9217757_39_5889_1375133.mp3',author:'deadowl',gender:'m',country:undefined},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/7/q/7q_9468274_39_5889.mp3',author:'mmdills22',gender:'f',country:undefined},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/w/4/w4_9410655_39_5889.mp3',author:'JessicaMS',gender:'f',country:undefined},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/6/a/6a_9125401_39_5889_197939.mp3',author:'enfield',gender:'f',country:'great britain'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/a/7/a7_9488892_39_5889.mp3',author:'Neptunium',gender:'m',country:'australia'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/i/3/i3_9007926_39_5889.mp3',author:'greengobbie92',gender:'m',country:'australia'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/2/m/2m_8992120_34_5889_6854.mp3',author:'enyovelcora',gender:'m',country:'austria'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/5/y/5y_9233940_302_5889.mp3',author:'Bartleby',gender:'m',country:'germany'},{url:'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/q/x/qx_9856882_41_5889.mp3',author:'7292961',gender:'m',country:'costa rica'}]}},{source:{type:'audio',name:'HowJSay.com',url:'https://howjsay.com/mp3/will.mp3'},data:{audio:[{url:'https://howjsay.com/mp3/will.mp3'}]}},{source:{type:'text',name:'Compromise Lexicon',url:'http://compromise.cool/'},data:{tag:[['Modal','Verb']]}}];
