A cheese strategy will often leave the cheeser at a significant disadvantage should the cheese fail.Perhaps the most popular example is the photon cannon rush, in which photon cannons are built in close proximity to the enemy base so that they can be used offensively. If spotted early, the cannon rush will likely fail and the defending player will have a significant economic advantage, exemplifying the high risk/high reward nature of cheese.A cheese strategy does NOT necessarily take advantage of imbalances in the game, and most cheeses are easily countered if they are spotted early and there is adequate time to prepare (hence why many cheeses rely on poor scouting).Cheese is often regarded as "cheap" or "dirty" play, as the player cheesing does not try to counter their opponent or adjust their strategy. "All-in" strategies are good examples of this.Below are some more examples of cheeses. Note how each cheese strategy takes advantage of "common" flaws in the defending player\'s build/strategy. If the flaw is not present, the cheese will likely be countered and lose:','Slang Term To mean "Money".\n\nOrgin: Everywhere - as old as welfare started.\n\nwhere in wellfare. people get free Money and  Govt.
