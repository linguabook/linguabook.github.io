survival and well-being. At the individual level, learning improves the quality of life of the participant. At a broader social level, it has the potential to transform cultures, societies, politics and the world we live in. The most profound period of learning takes place in childhood where accelerated development of the brain takes place (researchers estimate that around 16 billion synaptic receptors per second are developing in the brains of children between 12 - 18 months of age). Tragically, the damaging effects of childhood trauma, stress, neglect and exposure to drugs and alcohol in the uterus are affecting the physical development of an alarming number of children. This has frightening implications, not only for the life prospects and outcomes of individuals but also for society as a whole. Learning is a cornerstone for participation in life at every level. It is what makes humans the most powerful and influential species on the planet. It is vital that lifelong learning be nurtured, respected and participated in by all.","When drama-driven dumb asses drum up the bullshit at high levels often causing the most common of occurrences to be uncomfortable for all involved.","Failed attempts masked as valuable learning experience, oftentimes made by overpaid consultants and strategists.","A word frequently used by Manny and Fred to describe things learned in the field.","Im learning something now about choosing aside you cant keep everyone happy all the time pick a person you pledge your allegense dont sway !pick someone who will do the same for you or you waisting your time!","The end result of learning.
