It's kind of like having an alter ego that's much younger then yourself. Most littles don't act little 24/7, but when they do slip into their younger alter ego it's called slipping into headspace.When a little is in headspace that is when they are at their most submissive and most vulnerable, and sometimes even talk higher pitch or with more of a lisp then normal. They're more prone to emotional outbursts like throwing a tantrum or getting overly excited about something. They are also the most needy in this state, as they are not thinking like a grown up but like a child, and need a bit more guidence and reasurence. Some littles are shyer in headspace while others may become more outgoing. Every little is different and has their own headspace unique to them.The age range for littles is very broad and can range from newborn baby to toddler young child. 0-8 is usually the agreed range. It could be a fixed age like 3, but it could also be a range like 2-6.Littles tend to enjoy more childlike, babyish items such as pacifiers, sippy cups/bottles, stuffed animals, picture books, toy, games, younger looking clothing, pull-ups/ diapers, ect. Clothing and little items are different for each individual little.Terms for relationships:\nDDLG = Daddy Dom/Little Girl\nMDLB = for Mommy Dom/Little Boy\nDDLB = Daddy Dom/Little Boy\nMDLG = Mommy Dom/Little Girl\nCGL = for CareGiver/Little","When drama-driven dumb asses drum up the bullshit at high levels often causing the most common of occurrences to be uncomfortable for all involved.","A little is often the submissive partner of CGL relationship, though littles can be single too. Littles are often called names like baby girl or baby boy and princess or prince. They are more childish than their real age. For example, a 20 year old acting like a toddler. They often love coloring, stuffed animals, and watching cartoons. Depending on the age of the little, they may also require sippy cups and or pacifiers. More regressed littles will have a lisp. They often require rules such as bed time and punishments for doing something wrong. Many times, littles will be associated with other's called 'caregivers.' These caregivers can be female or male and are often refered to as 'mommy' or 'daddy.'","Something your Dick is","A little is the submissive partner of a DDLG relationship offtain called names like baby girl and princess.
