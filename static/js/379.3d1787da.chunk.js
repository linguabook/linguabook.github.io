A replacement for the word "cool" by metal heads.\nWhen something isn\'t metal it is considered Lame.',"When drama-driven dumb asses drum up the bullshit at high levels often causing the most common of occurrences to be uncomfortable for all involved.","A misunderstood type of music that can not easily be appreciated if you haven't heard much of it. It may take a long time for you to warm up to it, but as soon as you do, there's no turning back. Contrary to belief, metalheads are not stupid or angsty - that's just throwing around labels.","A type of music characterized by it's cacophonous wall of sound and accelerated tempo which is achieved through distorted electric guitars playing fast-paced riffs, with the driving drumbeat often utilizing hypersonic double bass rhythms and emphasizing the continuous pumping action, the bass guitar is often playing similar to the guitar, but more with the drums, so as to add to the overall heavyness and depth. It can manifest in many different forms and the spectrum of intensity is usually quite varied. From slow and heavy melodic grooves, to complex and precise blinding rhythms, odd time changes, and sheer brutality.. metal comes in many shapes and sizes. One common trait of metal is to have vocals dealing with dark subject matter, often sung with anger, aggression, and conviction in the form of screaming. Melodic smooth vocals are also accepted. Solos are an integral part of metal music, as the icing on the cake to complement the heavy intensity of the songs and add more depth and individuality. Real metal has a solo in every song, usually scales and arpeggios played with some changes often in 8th, 16th, or 32nd notes..if only a few quick licks. Metal is progressive and dynamic, and usually provokes feelings that are therapeutic to the listener. Metal is rock music that has evolved.","A heavier form of rock and roll music, that is definately not for everybody. However, if you like music that is violent, heavy, and generally badass, I recommend going to your nearest record store and buying a Priest or Maiden album. If you like rock music, but wish it was heavier, you won't regret it, trust me.There are many different types of metal. I'll list a few examples of each genre:","Gods gift to the world.","Aw man metal is fucking awesome!!"]}},{source:{type:"audio",name:"Forvo",url:"https://ru.forvo.com/word/metal/#en"},data:{audio:[{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/n/g/ng_8986017_39_402457_1.mp3",author:"kittymcvicious",gender:"f",country:void 0},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/m/w/mw_9042512_39_402457_741406.mp3",author:"Klaudi",gender:"m",country:void 0},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/t/n/tn_9004571_39_402457_710216.mp3",author:"davechristi",gender:"m",country:void 0},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/g/u/gu_9390970_39_402457.mp3",author:"SuperMom",gender:"f",country:void 0},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/7/n/7n_9045056_39_402457.mp3",author:"dorabora",gender:"f",country:"great britain"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/9/d/9d_9853898_39_402457.mp3",author:"eggypp",gender:"m",country:"great britain"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/l/p/lp_9323431_39_402457.mp3",author:"rsnmedia",gender:"m",country:"canada"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/x/f/xf_9007926_39_402457_761597.mp3",author:"greengobbie92",gender:"m",country:"australia"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/i/e/ie_9004627_41_402457_186266.mp3",author:"ablaert",gender:"m",country:"chile"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/2/j/2j_9514795_41_402457.mp3",author:"gardenvillage",gender:"m",country:"colombia"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/3/8/38_9245614_41_402457.mp3",author:"diegolacra",gender:"m",country:"spain"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/y/1/y1_8983506_49_402457_148374.mp3",author:"Kilitchikou",gender:"m",country:"france"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/j/0/j0_9315929_133_402457.mp3",author:"coohrus",gender:"m",country:"brazil"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/u/9/u9_8988162_133_402457_152701.mp3",author:"Dalivedo",gender:"m",country:"brazil"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/a/d/ad_10050587_133_402457.mp3",author:"bpduarte4",gender:"m",country:"portugal"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/b/h/bh_9568583_43_402457.mp3",author:"elenavegatxu",gender:"f",country:"spain"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/j/g/jg_9335233_183_402457.mp3",author:"yosl",gender:"m",country:"germany"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/z/c/zc_9915739_74_402457.mp3",author:"cinziatrab",gender:"f",country:"italy"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/v/a/va_9336784_168_402457.mp3",author:"aysaysbeybi",gender:"f",country:"turkey"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/d/3/d3_9176905_14_402457.mp3",author:"2335975",gender:"f",country:"azerbaijan"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/j/t/jt_9290139_33_402457.mp3",author:"Tankerman",gender:"m",country:"denmark"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/v/y/vy_9130730_131_402457.mp3",author:"saliko",gender:"m",country:"poland"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/8/5/85_9022780_131_402457_648816.mp3",author:"Rogacz",gender:"m",country:"poland"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/s/b/sb_9116823_22_402457_788656.mp3",author:"Fanchigo",gender:"m",country:"france"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/g/u/gu_9061520_137_402457_378412.mp3",author:"ariuccia",gender:"f",country:"italy"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/g/i/gi_8987174_223_402457_289670.mp3",author:"Aldedogn",gender:"m",country:"italy"},{url:"https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/v/l/vl_9425161_61_402457.mp3",author:"hardtocon",gender:"m",country:void 0}]}},{source:{type:"audio",name:"HowJSay.com",url:"https://howjsay.com/mp3/metal.mp3"},data:{audio:[{url:"https://howjsay.com/mp3/metal.mp3"}]}},{source:{type:"text",name:"Compromise Lexicon",url:"http://compromise.cool/"},data:{tag:[["Adjective"]]}}];a.default=function(){var e=i?r.a:r.b;return Object(o.jsx)(e,{text:"metal",lang:"en",data:i},void 0)}}}]);
