oranges.","The seasonal mean proportion of males was 0.552+0.012 compared to 0.448+0.012 for females, but with greater fluctuations among sampling dates compared to oranges.","Of the remaining single

densities of each instar were more variable in lemons (fig. 4b).","Following the emergence of adults, the overall numbers of adults were significantly lower in treated oranges despite early and late-season parity in numbers between treated and untreated oranges.","In the 2001 oranges, the peak mean density of each nymphal instar was relatively constant and extended into the adult stage at

also represent an incredible power on the part of marketing strategies and capability - finding themselves unable to sell lemons, have they successfully sold their lemons as oranges?","In the treated oranges, however, the proportion of the total nymphal population declined with each advancing instar (fig. 9), resulting in a distorted demographic structure of the immature population.","In contrast, the single prepositional phrases that did not use the bowl or plate as a reference object, for example in the oranges, were not included.","I have, however, said that sufficient oranges are being
