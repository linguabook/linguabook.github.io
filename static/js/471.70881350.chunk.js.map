Someone takes a power when they happen to poo and then shower without having to leave the bathroom.', 'The fundamental motivation for humans.  Lucifer fell from Heaven in his attempt to become God--the ultimate power grab.  Lucifer, as Satan, acting through the Serpent, suggested to Adam and Eve (the first humans created by God in his image) that they could become God luring them into rebellion him.  Following the pattern set by their original parents, all humans are driven by a desire to be God.  \\n\\nHumans, now in a fallen condition, are continually trying to one up each other. Even members of one\\'s own family or friends attempt to gain power over each other.  As Nietzsche pointed out, virtually all human behavior is motivated by the \"Will to Power.\"  Nature even rewards people with more power as they live longer, feel happier, and have higher levels of serotonin in their brain. People band together in an attempt to dominate other groups even more thoroughly. Wars, racism, economic competition, cutting remarks at parties, domestic violence can all be traced back to the urge to dominate others.  \\n\\nSubtly, even attempts to equalize wealth, income, social status, racial disparities are attempts by those without power to pull down and dominate those who are currently in power.  Equality of result is motivated by resentment and envy.  Efforts to equalize people\\'s conditions are movements by those who are presently less powerful to gain power over those who have dominated them.  Many times these less powerful people are aided by those with power who feel guilty that they have power but then assume power over the minorities they claim to help.  For example, witness the recent assertion by the Clintons that Martin Luther King and the black leadership in the Civil Rights Movement were not as effective in actually achieving their social goals until their cause was championed by white leftist liberals such as LBJ and themselves--meaning in clear language--shut up, stay in your place, and do not vote for that uppity Barack Obama.\\n\\nThe desire for power makes the entire project of the Left an impossibility.  People are selfish, sadistic, and power-crazy.  This urge for dominance will never change until the world as we know it ends. There is no exception in human history to hierarchy and inequality.  A more reasonable goal is to limit those in power and induce them to serve the common good as classical liberalism sought to do.', 'The last name of Austin, who has mojo.', 'A controlling entity that you cannot escape.', 'It keeps your internet working.\\n\\nPower goes, your internet goes, your mind explodes.'] } }, { source: { type: 'audio', name: 'Forvo', url: 'https://ru.forvo.com/word/power/#en' }, data: { audio: [{ url: 'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/5/r/5r_8990111_39_3991_166649.mp3', author: 'eris', gender: 'f', country: undefined }, { url: 'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/b/d/bd_9419634_39_3991.mp3', author: 'Marlfox', gender: 'm', country: undefined }, { url: 'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/d/8/d8_9744922_39_3991.mp3', author: '2Crow', gender: 'm', country: undefined }, { url: 'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/j/a/ja_8981864_39_3991_1369056.mp3', author: 'TopQuark', gender: 'm', country: 'great britain' }, { url: 'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/3/u/3u_9065958_39_3991_1363880.mp3', author: 'bananaman', gender: 'm', country: 'great britain' }, { url: 'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/l/a/la_9606133_39_3991.mp3', author: 'harbour1971', gender: 'f', country: 'great britain' }, { url: 'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/1/z/1z_9488892_39_3991.mp3', author: 'Neptunium', gender: 'm', country: 'australia' }, { url: 'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/7/1/71_10051056_39_3991.mp3', author: 'Alyssandra', gender: 'f', country: 'canada' }, { url: 'https://audio00.forvo.com/audios/mp3/e/x/ex_9233940_302_3991.mp3', author: 'Bartleby', gender: 'm', country: 'germany' }] } }, { source: { type: 'audio', name: 'HowJSay.com', url: 'https://howjsay.com/mp3/power.mp3' }, data: { audio: [{ url: 'https://howjsay.com/mp3/power.mp3' }] } }, { source: { type: 'text', name: 'Compromise Lexicon', url: 'http://compromise.cool/' }, data: { tag: [['Uncountable', 'Noun']] } }];\nvar StaticCard = function () {\n    var Card = DATA ?
