A SAW is a fully automatic machine gun (as opposed to an assault rifle) that is usually issued to one soldier of a team of soldiers. \n\nGenerally used as a reference to the current machine gun designated as M249, or the FN Minimi machine gun. This gun can carry 100 or 200 bullets in a single magazine and fires between 750 to 1000 rounds a minute. \n\nPrevious examples of squad automatic weapons in combat are the M-60 during the Vietnam conflict, and the Browning Automatic Rifle used in World War II.  \n\n2.
