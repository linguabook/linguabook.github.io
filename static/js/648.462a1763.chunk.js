Usually it does not qualify as a train unless there are more than 7 men involved but the term train is used to describe any number that is more than 1 with a female. The female has sex with a man and after he cums another man enters the room to have sex with the female and so forth. It is only considered a train when the woman is fully aware of the situation and allows for the men to have sex with her. Otherwise it would be considered rape. \n\nDiffers and is often confused with gang bang.
